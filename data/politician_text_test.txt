You can count on the United States. We will be there. We wont abandon the field. We will stick up for free enterprise and free people.
We simply cant get the best deals without TPA. Thats why weve got to pass it as soon as possible. #TPA4USjobs
This bill would enhance Congresss power. TPA empowers Congress. #TPA4USjobs
Nothing has done more to lift people out of poverty around the world than free enterprise. #TPA4USjobs
If we dont write the rules of the global economy, somebody else willsomebody who may not have our best interests at heart. #TPA4USjobs
When we complete trade agreements we strengthen our ties with other countries. #TPA4USjobs
The American worker can compete with anybodyif given a fair chance. And only a trade agreement can give you that fair chance. #TPA4USjobs
The problem isnt when other countries play by the rules. Its when they break the rules. #TPA4USjobs
More trade means more peoplefrom every countrybuying, selling, investing, creatingall working together to build a better world.

Obama's Nuclear Framework Agreement is destined to fail, just like the one that Clinton negotiated w N Korea two decades ago. #IranTalks
Trust but verify is common refrain in foreign policy; but if you can't trust your negotiating partner, this can't be applied. #IranTalks
Obama's Framework Announcement is the most misguided since Chamberlain's "Peace in Our Time." http://t.co/6yTsaeNFy4
.@WashingtonPost Editorial Board: Obamas Iran deal falls far short of his own goals http://t.co/3yujAelgRB
What will stop a #NuclearIran is a strong America. Period. We need a president who understands our enemy &amp; is not afraid to lead. #IranTalks
RT @FaceTheNation: Former Sen. @RickSantorum joins the broadcast Sunday to talk about #RFRA, #Iran, 2016 &amp; more
Iran is an untrustworthy adversary. Making a deal gives them space to develop a nuclear weapon. This is not in the interest of the US.
Iran is not a country that you can negotiate with. They have never kept a single treaty. #IranTalks
The true test of whether the #IranTalks produced a good deal --&gt; take it to Congress for ratification.

Washington is broken. Trust me, Ive seen it first-hand.

The answers to the challenges facing our nation will only come from the people!
Were going to make 2016 a national referendum on repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS!
The simplest and most important regulatory reform is we need to repeal every word of Obamacare! #FullRepeal
We start to reignite the promise of America by bringing back jobs, growth, and opportunity.
There has been no country in the history of the world that has allowed so many to start with nothing and achieve anything.
We are all here because we love our kids and were worried about the direction this country is going.

We need regulatory reform. The simplest and most important regulatory reform? Repeal every word of Obamacare! #FullRepeal #iapolitics
The single best tax reform? We should adopt a flat tax! And when we do that, we should #AbolishTheIRS! #iapolitics
