Great band of #libertarians! #ISFLCHas anyone else noticed that #Congress and #Obama have stopped RAISING the debt limit in favor of SUSPENDING it altogether? #tcot #tlotOk folks, Great questions! Apologies to those I didn't get to, but let's do this again soon.  Thanks for joining me! #GovGary@burtlikko Judge Jim Gray (Ret) &amp; Judge Napolitano! #GovGary@Ckel09 I applaud Michelle Obama's raising  awareness, and that is where the federal role should end. #GovGary@chefchadwells I see it as a fear that politicians have planted in order to be reelected, despite its obvious failure. #GovGary@Joi4liberty I certainly hope so! Thanks for your help, by the way! #GovGary@robustus A BALANCED budget, which would be 25-30% less than current. #GovGary@JeffClorley Enacting the FairTax will get rid of 80% of lobbyists. RE campaign finance, 100% transparency. #GovGary@american121 I agree with your premise, which is why I probably vetoed more legislation than all other govs combined. #GovGary@DanPowell80 I'm still in NM! #GovGary@L_Brooke_0 I am in the camp that QE will not have a happy ending! #GovGary@DeeJayPollok That is the $64k question.  That is what I am trying to do! #GovGary@pst_puff_pass @janalynn99 Odds are zero if left to their own devices. Elected officials will have to force change. #GovGary@pst_puff_pass @LanierCorey The cause of high tuition cost is directly related to the ease of guaranteed student loans. #GovGary@GigPaul @q2foou Yes #GovGary@MilkMushMeat In order: Abolish, change it, and failing those, enforce it as legally required by the Constitution. #GovGary@built4living To provide the science. #GovGary@InceptionOfDixi Thomas Jefferson #GovGary@Lishy93 If the person I appointed allowed that, he would find him or herself w/o a job very quickly. #GovGary@ncolby33 It is possible, given that I am the only fiscally conservative, flaming social liberal politician out there. #GovGary@ogkingscott I'd bite off as much spending reduction, nonintervention, greater civil liberties as possible. #GovGary@chefchadwells Ending prohibition of drugs, esp. marijuana, will go a long wary.  Militarization has its roots in the drug "war". #GovGary@BlockJeremy I would prefer it not be taxed, but I will take a tax over continued Prohibition. #GovGary@ChrisMeigs Good question.  It seems to have worked really well. (Not) #GovGary@BobbyBrown1011 This November. Antarctica. #GovGary@Ckel09 That they should remain separated. #GovGary@WiscoLiberty Both parties need to share in the blame equally. #GovGary@Tothian @govgaryjohnson We ended up with 1200 fewer employers simply by managing attrition, which I was confident we could do. #GovGary@JimCristea Start with looking at is as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue. #GovGary@janalynn99 @TacoFetus For me, about as thrilling as it gets. #GovGary@libertyspot @BobbyBrown1011 Diplomacy and a discussion about free trade. #GovGary@TacoFetus Bush #GovGary@WiscoLiberty I would like to believe that if I had been in Congress, I would have opposed, but I wasn't in that position. #GovGary@AlmondD @AlmondD It is disastrous. #GovGary@janalynn99 @WiscoLiberty How can anyone support freedom and not an individuals personal choice to us marijuana? #GovGary@Tyler_Silvestri Grateful that he did what he did. #GovGary@TacoFetus Ten years, which given our history, is pretty darn immediate. #GovGary@rdlln Reducing spending - by enough to achieve a balanced budget. #GovGary@NYDanSanchez We will find ourselves with tens of millions of new enemies we wouldn't have absent milit. interventions. #GovGary@CarissaMoleski Make is as easy as possible for someone to come here and work, with a work visa. Don't build fence - that's nuts. #GovGary@erik_sundell With full blown vouchers, ALL public schools would be charter schools. #GovGary@Silly_ginger310 I advocate eliminating income taxes, business taxes in favor of consumption tax. The whole country gets to work! #GovGary@ExhibitCE399 Yes, Food Stamps would exist, but would be cut back along with ALL federal expenditures. #GovGary@filmmaking_fkp Apples to apples, oranges to oranges, it is cheaper -- and isn't that good govt. #GovGary@jddunne22 Thanks for the kind words, but no thanks! #GovGaryOK, let's get started.
