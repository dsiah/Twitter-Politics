@milkmushmeat in order: abolish, change it, and failing those, enforce it as legally required by the constitution. #govgary
@lishy93 if the person i appointed allowed that, he would find him or herself w/o a job very quickly. #govgary
@ncolby33 it is possible, given that i am the only fiscally conservative, flaming social liberal politician out there. #govgary
@ogkingscott i'd bite off as much spending reduction, nonintervention, greater civil liberties as possible. #govgary
@chefchadwells ending prohibition of drugs, esp. marijuana, will go a long wary.  militarization has its roots in the drug "war". #govgary
@blockjeremy i would prefer it not be taxed, but i will take a tax over continued prohibition. #govgary
@ckel09 that they should remain separated. #govgary
@wiscoliberty both parties need to share in the blame equally. #govgary
@janalynn99 @tacofetus for me, about as thrilling as it gets. #govgary
@tacofetus bush #govgary
@wiscoliberty i would like to believe that if i had been in congress, i would have opposed, but i wasn't in that position. #govgary
@janalynn99 @wiscoliberty how can anyone support freedom and not an individuals personal choice to us marijuana? #govgary
@rdlln reducing spending - by enough to achieve a balanced budget. #govgary
@erik_sundell with full blown vouchers, all public schools would be charter schools. #govgary
@exhibitce399 yes, food stamps would exist, but would be cut back along with all federal expenditures. #govgary
@filmmaking_fkp apples to apples, oranges to oranges, it is cheaper -- and isn't that good govt. #govgary

"government reaches deal with tech firms on data requests". but...the deal has to be approved by a fisa judge. #nsa

#obama: "i have confidence the nsa is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around." i don't share that confidence. @eff #tlot
"federal judge says #nsa data-gathering program is unconstitutional". i couldn't agree more.  #tlot #privacy @eff
why am i more comfortable with #amazondrones than i am with govt drones operating over u.s.? #tlot #privacy #primeair
