in a 60 minutes interview this weekend, obama said the islamic state caught him by surprise. here's my response:
remember when israeli pm benjamin netanyahu told the obama administration, "dont ever second guess me again,"?
obama pledged to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the islamic state in iraq, syria and beyond. join the conversation:
obama says we don't have a strategy. i say we do; it's "searching for a monster to destroy." my (premium) video:
obama's strategy for isis, iraq should be 'just come home'
to obama on iraq forming stable government and unify to oppose isis: lots of luck
"...it appears we will not admit the folly of our iraqi policy, and we wont come home until we are flat out broke."
imagine a commander in chief standing up with clarity and saying we will defeat radical islamic terrorism! #nraam
