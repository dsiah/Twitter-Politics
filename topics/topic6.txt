the president is required by law to tell the people how he would implement defense cuts, but chooses to ignore the deadline for doing so.

some think obamacare is the same as free healthcare  but this healthcare law has come at a very high price.
interesting that @barackobama admits that he cut $716 billion from medicare from current seniors to pay for obamacare.
