Americas farmers cant afford the job-destroying tax hikes &amp; higher death taxes a second @BarackObama term will bring. 
My vision for a vibrant rural America puts forth agriculture policies that support farmers and ranchers. Read my Plan 
It is time to change course in the Middle East. America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose, and resolve in our might.
The 21st century began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.
If America does not lead, others will  others who do not share our interests and our values. 
Americas security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years.
The choice is clear. The middle class can't afford four more years of
@BarackObama's tax hikes. 
Even @BarackObama's own campaign has admitted that he is spreading
falsehoods about my tax plan.

On welfare reforms 16th anniversary, its clear that @BarackObama still doesnt support the bipartisan achievement. 
Whether it's raising taxes or cutting Medicare, @BarackObama's healthcare law has come at a high cost. 
Obamacare raises taxes on families making less than 120k. I will repeal it. 
After @BarackObama gutted welfare reform last month, there isnt much to celebrate on its 16th anniversary today. 
Some think Obamacare is the same as free healthcare  but this healthcare law has come at a very high price.

Today, the House delivered a responsible, #BalancedBudget. 
Proud of my colleagues for working together to advance a responsible, #BalancedBudget. 
A great post from House Budget Vice Chairman @RepTomPrice: The Path to a Responsible, #BalancedBudget 
Benedict XVIs papacy is a blessing to the world. Our prayers go with him for physical health &amp; spiritual strength. 
Today's CBO report is yet another warning that our deficit is unsustainable. 
I'm disappointed the President missed his budget deadline. Every missed deadline is a missed opportunity. 
Washington should spend less, not take more. 
I'm looking forward to talking with @DavidGregory on @meetthepress tomorrow morning. #mtp
Our tactics will vary, but our strategy will remain the same. We will promote conservatism at every opportunity. 
We have a moral obligation to budget responsibly and to tackle this debt crisis. 
I congratulate President Obama on his inauguration, and I join the country in celebrating this American tradition. 
Senate Democrats have refused to pass a budget. Time to hold them accountable for this legal and moral failure. 
We must pay bills today &amp; ensure we can pay bills tomorrow. To do that, we must cut spending &amp; budget responsibly. 
A historical perspective on budget deadlines: 
A small step toward fiscal sanity? Propose a budget and do so on time: 
Proud to support @MarcoRubios effort to expand opportunity in America:  
President Obama's tax hikes are bad for jobs and dont fix the debt crisis, as this chart shows. #SpendingIsTheProblem 
Last night, I had the great privilege to meet WI heroes from the Greatest Generation, Joe Demler and Julian Plaster. 
Jack Kemp was a great American and a great mentor. Proud to join @marcorubio at the 2012 Kemp Dinner. Watch live here: 
Honor Flight: A powerful tribute to America's heroes. Check out the new Veterans Day trailer: 
To all those who have served and their families, thank you for your service and sacrifice. #VeteransDay
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and everyone in Oak Creek who has been impacted by this tragic act of violence.
The complex tax code stifles economic growth. You deserve a tax code that is fair, simple &amp; competitive. 
The House took action today to protect families &amp; workers from a massive tax increase in January 2013. 
Let's #StopTheTaxHike and push pro-growth tax reform to encourage job creation and advance prosperity: 
Limited, effective government should do what it does well, not suffocate the economy and crowd out civil society - 
Spoke with @SykesCharlie about the cost of Obamacare &amp; the President's confusion w/ free enterprise &amp; civil society -  
Gov't can help create the space for innovation &amp; prosperity, but it doesn't fill that space  and it shouldn't try to: 
We face a choice of 2 futures: stay on President's path of debt &amp; decline, or renew American idea &amp; restore prosperity 
Looking forward to it. RT @guypbenson: Big #Hewitt show tonight...as @mkhammer and I guest host. 6-9pm ET 
The President's health care law remains terrible policy and must be repealed:  #FullRepeal
The President's proposed tax increase on successful small businesses doesn't even pay for 1/5 of his deficit spending: 
The American people will be the judge and jury of this law come November. #Fullrepeal 
Im very disappointed, but we are not deterred. We think we can still repeal this law if we win this election. 
The health care law still raises costs and will blow an even deeper hole in the deficit -#FullRepeal -  
Looking fwd to talking w/ @SykesCharlie about growing case for #FullRepeal &amp; Replace. Live at 11:35 AM CT - 
With the right leadership, we will pass #FullRepeal &amp; advance real health care solutions for the American people. 
The law's fate is in the hands of the American ppl &amp; their elected leaders. Today's decision strengthens case for #FullRepeal &amp; Replace.
Insisting on empty promises instead of real reform is a moral failure. Lessons from Europe &amp; California: 
My sincere gratitude to @JebBush for the insights he shared w/ Budget Cmte today. Highlights &amp; full video here:

Honored to give Keynote Address @TheBushCenter conference in NYC @ 2pmET, live here:  Topic: Choice of #2Futures we face
Let Congress know how you feel about the issues that matter most to you. Do that by writing your Rep here:   #WriteRep
The President attacks our Budget & SCOTUS for same reason: he takes any questions of his vision of limitless gov't as a personal affront.
Point by point, myth by myth, claim by claim, we set the record straight on the choice of #2Futures America faces here: 
Only 3 certainties in life: Death, taxes & inaccurate attacks by @BarackObama on serious budgets. A fact check here: 
Like his 4 budgets, todays speech by @BarackObama is as revealing as it is disappointing: 
History will not be kind to those that chose to duck & run from our generations defining challenge: 
We all thought @BarackObama would be better than this. He had potential, making his leadership failures so disappointing.
On 1,065th day that @SenateDems failed to pass a budget, the House again met its legal & moral obligations: 
I couldn't be prouder of my colleagues who have joined me in this historic vote to meet Americas defining challenge:

We face the most predictable economic crisis in history.You deserve better than the Presidents path to debt &amp; decline: 
Americans deserve solutions &amp; leaders undeterred by political attacks. Preventing a debt crisis is a moral obligation: 
We believe Washington doesnt have all the answers. Govt closer to you is govt more responsive to you: 
The #hcr law puts 15 bureaucrats in power. We give power to 50 million seniors. Whos side are you on? #15vs50million

This is your country. Your future. Your choice: 
The Presidents budget keeps spending &amp; borrowing. @SenateDems refuse to pass a budget. This budget fulfills its duty: 
If you agree its morally wrong to ignore the most predictable crisis in U.S. history, this is your budget:

CBO confirms another broken promise in #hcr law: 3 to 5 million *per year* will get pushed out of existing insurance 
FYI: House overwhelmingly passed bipartisan #JOBSAct today. It helps #smallbiz startups grow & create jobs. Learn more: 
The #hcr law continues to unravel as bipartisan agreement to repeal #IPAB takes another step forward: 
Todays @WaysandMeansGOP vote to repeal #IPAB is important step to removing partisan roadblock to bipartisan solutions. 
Great news: Democrats keep agreeing w/ GOP that the #IPAB panel of 15 bureaucrats in the new #hcr law has to go: 
The #hcr law lets 15 unelected bureaucrats have power to decide what care you can & cant have. It's called #IPAB 
This is an astonishing stat from CBO: a majority of govt transfers no longer go to the lowest income quintile: 
I just posted on @PovertyNews: Government Must Refocus Its Safety Net to Those in Need  
Its day 1,037 w/o a budget from @SenateDems - and the 4th straight year President Obama has defied the law on this: 
The Presidents unserious approach to Medicare will have serious consequences for seniors:  cc: @SenatorSessions
Despite a clear legal requirement, for 4th straight year Pres. Obama has failed to lead on need to strengthen Medicare: 
.@SenatorSessions & I sent a letter to Pres. Obama this AM about his legal requirement to advance Medicare solutions: 
Pres. Obama has chosen to isolate himself from the growing bipartisan consensus on how to save+strengthen Medicare: 
Today's hearing made it clear: the merciless math of our fiscal trajectory gets increasingly worse the longer we wait: 
Our trustees and everybody who speaks on this has opined extensively about the value of acting sooner [vs] later. 
Medicares Chief Actuary: giving seniors greater choice & freedom is an ideal path to improve quality & contain costs: 
Social Security's Chief Actuary: P. Obama's failure to lead on SocSec will result in 23% benefit cut 4 current seniors:

Debt crisis is staring us in the face. President's budget kicks the can down road, leads to Greece, path to decline: 
From @meetthepress w/ @davidgregory this AM - The Serious Consequences of the President's Unserious Budget - 
From page 58 of Presidents budget: our fiscal position gradually deteriorates. Built to last? Or drowning in debt? 
From page 58 of the Presidents budget: in 10 years Americas fiscal position gradually deteriorates. Built to last? 
Secretary Geithner made it clear yesterday: the Presidents budget includes no solutions, shows no leadership: 
Too many in Washington are making empty promises - trillions of dollars of empty promises.  #AskTheGreeks
Treasury Sec Geithner today admitted that they "don't have a definitive solution" to our debt threat: 
.@SenatorSessions and I wrote an op-ed on the Presidents latest budget failure: Obamas Dereliction of Duty  
Video highlights from today's hearing, charts debunking the Presidents unserious budget & more can be found here: 
The Presidents budget director contradicts the Presidents #SCOTUS case on constitutionality of his health care: law 
When does the President's so-called "balanced" approach balance the budget? Answer: Never. Watch:  #AskTheGreeks
President continues to assert that his budget cuts the deficit by $4 trillion. The claim is simply false:  #AskTheGreeks
The Presidents budget represents a stunning dereliction of duty:  - For where his path ends, just #AskTheGreeks
House GOP will propose & pass a serious budget. Sounds novel these days, but leaders have a legal&moral obligation to budget. #AskTheGreeks
From @KudlowReport -  - Stacking up empty promises & massive debt has painful consequences. #AskTheGreeks
The Presidents budget kicks the debt can down the road. More empty promises & the same failed leadership. #AskTheGreeks how that works out.
I'll show how the Presidents budget leads us on a path of debt, doubt & decline on @TheKudlowReport (730pmET) & @Gretawire (10pmET) tonight

This was the Presidents last budget to propose solutions to our debt crisis. He chose not to. Again.  #ObamaBudgetFail
The Presidents commitment to higher spending makes it difficult to keep promises-especially this "big" broken promise: 
Broken promises & recycled gimmicks in #ObamaBudgetFail widen his credibility deficit - 
The President refuses to honestly confront our nations most pressing challenges:   #ObamaBudgetFail
The facts you should know about the #ObamaBudgetFail    An unserious budget w/ serious consequences.
The Presidents budget ensures debt crisis & decline  #ObamaBudgetFail
The Presidents refusal to work together to advance serious solutions? Disappointing to say the least: 
Despite @SenateDems budget failures, leaders have moral obligation 2 offer solutions to tackle our biggest problems. 
President's #hcr law gives a board of 15 unelected bureaucrats control of Medicare, leading to denied care for seniors:

Theres been lots of talk about reforming the tax code lately. I made a video 6 weeks ago on how it could be done: 
.@WSJ writes that new #hcr law is unraveling as math and reality arent matching what was promised. Its a good read: 
Its been 900 days since Senate Dems took srsly their legal&moral duty to produce a budget #900DaysWithoutASenateBudget 
I made a 60sec video about Senate Dems failing one of most basic functions of your gov't. #900DaysWithoutASenateBudget 
With administrations admission that CLASS Act is a budget gimmick, the Presidents #hcr law is beginning to crumble: 
#900DaysWithoutASenateBudget defies the law & disrespects the public they serve.  via @NROCorner cc: @SenatorSessions
I explain in this video how raising taxes hurts job creation. Its no wonder businesses arent hiring. Take a look: 
Gov't has legal & moral obligation to budget. This Sunday, Oct 16th marks #900DaysWithoutASenateBudget
As I said on the House floor today, If youre standing still in trade youre falling behind. 
Job creation isnt a function of govt spending  a painful lesson of the failed stimulus. Pro-growth reforms needed: 
5 years ago I watched Pres. Obama sign the Affordable Care Act. We should all be proud of the difference it's made in millions of lives Joe

Obama's Nuclear Framework Agreement is destined to fail, just like the one that Clinton negotiated w N Korea two decades ago. #IranTalks
Trust but verify is common refrain in foreign policy; but if you can't trust your negotiating partner, this can't be applied. #IranTalks
Obama's Framework Announcement is the most misguided since Chamberlain's "Peace in Our Time."

Iran is an untrustworthy adversary. Making a deal gives them space to develop a nuclear weapon. This is not in the interest of the US.
Iran is not a country that you can negotiate with. They have never kept a single treaty. #IranTalks

Great time with courageous conservatives at @BeaconDriveInSC in Spartanburg this afternoon. 
Washington is broken. Trust me, Ive seen it first-hand.

The answers to the challenges facing our nation will only come from the people!
Were going to make 2016 a national referendum on repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS!
The simplest and most important regulatory reform is we need to repeal every word of Obamacare! #FullRepeal
We start to reignite the promise of America by bringing back jobs, growth, and opportunity.
There has been no country in the history of the world that has allowed so many to start with nothing and achieve anything.
We are all here because we love our kids and were worried about the direction this country is going.
